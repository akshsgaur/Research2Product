🧠🤖 Morphik Multi-Agent Research-to-Product System

AI agents analyze research papers via Morphik's visual understanding, find product opportunities

A sophisticated multi-agent AI system that automatically transforms academic research papers into actionable product opportunities using Morphik's enterprise-grade visual document understanding.
🎯 What It Does
Upload a research paper → Get comprehensive product opportunities with market analysis, technical feasibility, and business strategy.
🤖 The Agent Team

Dr. Vision (Visual Research Analyst) - Interprets figures, charts, and diagrams
Alex Chen (Technical Lead) - Assesses implementation feasibility and technical challenges
Sam Rodriguez (Product Manager) - Identifies market opportunities and user needs
Jordan Kim (Business Strategist) - Evaluates commercial potential and revenue models
Dr. Casey Wang (Research Analyst) - Validates research quality and academic significance

✨ Key Features

🔍 Visual Document Understanding: Powered by Morphik's ColPali for true multimodal analysis
🧠 Multi-Agent Collaboration: 5 specialized AI agents provide comprehensive perspectives
🎯 Product Opportunity Generation: Automatic identification of commercial applications
🧹 Auto-Cleanup: Documents automatically deleted after analysis for privacy
📊 Rich Analytics: Confidence scores, processing metrics, and source attribution

🚀 Quick Start
Prerequisites

Morphik Account: Sign up at morphik.ai
Python 3.8+
OpenAI API Key (optional, for enhanced product opportunities)

Installation
bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/morphik-multi-agent-research
cd morphik-multi-agent-research
pip install -r requirements.txt
Environment Setup
bash# Required: Your Morphik URI
export MORPHIK_URI="morphik://owner_id:token@api.morphik.ai"

# Optional: OpenAI key for enhanced product opportunity generation
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"
Run the System
bashpython morphik_multiagent.py
Open your browser to http://localhost:5001 and start analyzing research papers!
📋 How It Works
1. Document Ingestion
python# Morphik processes the PDF with visual understanding
document = morphik.ingest_file(pdf_path, use_colpali=True)
2. Multi-Agent Analysis
Each agent analyzes the document from their specialized perspective:
python# Content-based search - no complex filtering needed
response = morphik.query(
    query=agent_specific_query,
    use_colpali=True,
    k=5
)
3. Collaborative Synthesis
Agents' insights are combined into a comprehensive analysis and concrete product opportunities.
4. Automatic Cleanup
Document is automatically deleted after analysis for privacy and storage efficiency.
🎨 Web Interface
Beautiful, intuitive interface featuring:

Drag & drop PDF upload
Real-time progress tracking
Agent-by-agent analysis display
Interactive product opportunity cards
One-click document querying

🛠️ Advanced Configuration
Custom Agent Queries
python# Override default agent behavior
insight = team.analyze_with_agent(
    "technical_lead", 
    custom_query="Focus on blockchain implementation challenges"
)
Manual Cleanup Control
python# Disable auto-cleanup for debugging
results = team.run_collaborative_analysis(auto_cleanup=False)

# Manual cleanup when ready
team.cleanup_document()
